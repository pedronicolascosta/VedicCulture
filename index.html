                  <p>“The study of Hindu Symbolism guides the mind towards Eternal Truths, through which the wisdom of India has been flowing for centuries and centuries, through stories and fables represented in dance and drama, portrayed in paintings and sculptures, inducing the man to follow the model of life that points him to Eternal Happiness.”</p>
                  <p>In the Vedic Tradition (Hinduism), Shiva is seen as one of the pillars of the Hindu Trinity: Brahma - the Creator, Vishnu - the Preserver, and Shiva - god of profound transformation, god of destruction for a renewal, responsible for the dissolution of Creation. Of course, the Trinity only performs its functions in partnership with its devis or Divine Mothers: Sarasvati - the Knowledge to create, Lakshmi - the Prosperity to maintain, and Parvati (or Durga) - the Matter to be transformed.</p>

                  <p>Kamadeva – a Sanskrit compound word meaning desire, love (kama) and god (deva) – is known in Hindu Mythology as the God of Love.</p>
                  <p>According to a hymn in the Rg Veda, Kama is worshiped by the gods and it is said that there is no one like him. According to another hymn, he is the god of sexual love, like the Eros of the Greeks and the Cupid of the Latins.</p>
                  <p>Kamadeva is usually represented as a beautiful young man who holds a bow and an arrow of flowers. He travels around the three worlds, as the personification of spring, accompanied by his wife Rati (meaning pleasure) and surrounded by gentle breezes. In Bengal, there are no images representing him, but he is adored on the occasion of marriage and the bride and groom ask him for happiness in marriage and for the offspring.</p>

                  <p>We started publishing on our website the history of Yoga written by the master Paulo Murilo Rosas, who brought the technique of Dakshina Tantra from India to Brazil. Divided into four chapters, the narrative will allow knowledge about the origins of this ancient practice, which has helped people so much in the search for self-knowledge and personality balance.</p></div>

                    <h2>pre-classical yoga</h2>
                    <p>We will start our studies using Western parameters and, therefore, adopt the current nomenclature, dividing the exhibition into: Pre-Classical Yoga, Classical Yoga, Post-Classical Yoga and Contemporary Yoga.</p>
                    <p>The word Yoga is found in the Vedas, more specifically in the various Upanishads, always with the meaning of everything that serves as a means to achieve personality balance and self-knowledge.</p>
                    <p>The time of the emergence of Pre-Classical Yoga is around 5,000 to 3,000 BC and is based on the flourishing of the so-called Indo/Saraswati civilization and, consequently, on the research carried out in the cities discovered in this region such as: Mohenjo-Daro, Harappa, Kalibangan and in the port city of Lothal.</p>

                    <h2>classic yoga</h2>
                    <p>According to tradition, the creator of Yoga as a philosophy was Hiranyagarba, although researchers do not tire of affirming that the Yoga of Patanjali represents a climax in the long and continuous development of this philosophy. Despite considering him only a compiler and systematizer, in any case, the importance of his work: the “Yoga Sutras” cannot be denied.</p>
                    <p>Some historians point to Patanjali's birth around the 2nd century AD, others think he lived around the 2nd century BC and claim that he was the one who wrote the "Maha-Bhashya", the grammar of the Sanskrit language.</p>
                    <p>Patanjali's Sutras have four chapters:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>The First Call of Samadhi Pada (Chapter on Enlightenment)</li>
                      <li>The second call of Sadhana Pada (Chapter of Discipline).</li>
                      <li>The third called Vibhuti Pada (Chapter of Powers).</li>
                      <li>The fourth called Kaivalya Pada (Final Realization Chapter).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Post-Classical Yoga</h2>
                    <p>The existing literature from this phase is very rich in content, we have the Samhitas, the Agamas and the Nigamas, the Puranas and the Yoga Upanishads, which emerged between the 7th to 17th centuries AD.</p>
                    <p>Samhitas (collections) are texts of the Vaishnava tradition that were organized into four parts:</p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>Jnanapada, deals with metaphysics or wisdom.</li>
                      <li>Yogapada, deals with Yoga techniques.</li>
                      <li>Kriyapada, deals with the building of temples and the creation of sacred images.</li>
                      <li>Caryapada, deals with religious practices and rituals.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>One of the earliest Samhitas was Satvata, and one of the most famous is Vishnu Samhita which presents a six-limbed Yoga, while the Ahirbudhnya Samhita while accepting Patanjali's division defines Yoga in concepts of unity: the union of the individual self (Jiva) with the transcendent (Atma).</p>
                    <p>Agamas and Nigamas are texts from the Tantrism tradition and are presented in the form of a dialogue between Shiva and Shakti. The texts in which Shiva is the Guru are called Agama; and the texts in which Shakti is the Guru are called Nigama.</p>
                    <p>Their main purpose is to give liberation to the Jiva by proposing a method whereby monistic truth is attained through the world of duality.</p>
